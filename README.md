# HeroCity
Who manages the town the hero visits? You do chief!

This is a long term project developed by Zulfikar Yusufali starting 5/18/2015.
It is a game similar to sim city, however it is for the hero which visits the town often noted in the popular rpg genre.
You manage the citizens of the town, trying to maintain a healthy environment for them as well as visiting heroes.
If town is not managed, the heros might get mad and leave,
or worse,
start rampaging.

Note :
The citizen will be able to be equipped with gear to defend against random attack from monster and escapees from the dungeon. They however, won't be as strong as the hero, so be sure to have items ready for the heroes.
