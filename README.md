# HeroCity
Who manages the town the hero visits? You do chief!

This is a project developed me starting 5/18/2015.
It is a game similar to sim city, but for the hero which visits the town like in popular rpg genre.
You manage your citizens and maintain a healthy environment for them as well as visiting heroes.
If town is not managed, heros might get mad and leave,
or worse,
start rampaging.
You need the heroes to clear out dungeons to gather resources to expand your town.
